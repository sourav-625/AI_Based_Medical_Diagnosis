## REFERRALS

- NEUROLOGIST: The patient's episodes of "freezing" and subsequent confusion could be indicative of a neurological issue. The neurologist should conduct a thorough neurological examination, including cognitive and motor function assessments. The patient's history of a fall and mild concussion should be taken into account, as well as the recent onset of these episodes. The neurologist should look for signs of conditions such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), seizures, or other neurological disorders.

## LABS & TESTS

- EEG (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM): This test will help to identify any abnormal electrical activity in the brain that could be causing the patient's episodes. It can help to rule in or out conditions such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders.

- MRI OF THE BRAIN: This imaging test will provide a detailed view of the patient's brain, allowing for the identification of any structural abnormalities, such as lesions or tumors, that could be causing the patient's symptoms. It can also help to assess the extent of any damage from the patient's previous concussion.

- COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) AND METABOLIC PANEL: These tests will help to identify any underlying medical conditions, such as anemia or electrolyte imbalances, that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

- CAROTID ULTRASOUND: This test can help to identify any blockages or narrowing in the carotid arteries, which could lead to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) - brief episodes of neurological dysfunction caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to the brain. This could potentially explain the patient's episodes of "freezing" and subsequent confusion.
