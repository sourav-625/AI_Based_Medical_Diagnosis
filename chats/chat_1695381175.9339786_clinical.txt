## SENSES

SIGHT: Look for any signs of physical discomfort or distress during the episodes. Observe for any involuntary movements, twitching, or changes in facial expression. 

SOUND: Listen for any changes in speech patterns or coherence before, during, and after the episodes. 

TOUCH: Check for any changes in muscle tone or responsiveness during the episodes. 

SMELL: No specific smells are expected to be relevant in this case.

## EXAMINATION

- NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: Assess the patient's cognitive function, motor function, and sensory function. This can help identify any neurological abnormalities that may be causing the episodes. Look for signs of Parkinson's disease, stroke, or other neurological conditions.
- EEG (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM): This test can help identify any abnormal electrical activity in the brain that may be causing the episodes. Look for signs of seizure activity or other abnormalities.
- MRI OR CT SCAN: These imaging tests can help identify any structural abnormalities in the brain that may be causing the episodes. Look for signs of brain injury, tumors, or other abnormalities.
